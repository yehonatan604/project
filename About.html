            <h1>About Mardi Gras</h1>
            <p>The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th
                and
                18th
                centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or
                fatted
                calf,
                followed France to her colonies.<br>
                On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot
                of
                ground 60
                miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it was
                the
                eve of the
                festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702.
                In
                1703, the
                tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.<br>
                In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our
                current
                Mardi Gras
                krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711 through
                1861. The
                procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade
                with
                an actual
                bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.<br>
                New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New
                Orleans, but not
                with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
                established elegant
                society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.<br>
                The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                governing
                body. That
                year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and
                carnival
                organizations
                formed in New Orleans.<br>
                By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to
                celebrate Mardi
                Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and lent each event
                an
                exciting air
                of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking
                John
                Milton's
                hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling
                floats (known
                as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.<br>

            <h1>The Mayor of New Orleans</h1>
            <h3>LaToya Cantrell</h3>
            <img class="w-25" src="Assets\images\mayor.png" alt="LaToya Cantrell">
            <br><br>
            <p>
                She is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana since May 7, 2018.<br>
                A Democrat,
                Cantrell is the
                first woman to hold the office. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New
                Orleans
                City Council
                from 2012 - 2018.<br>
                Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier
                University of
                Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology.[3] She attended an executive training program at the
                Harvard
                Kennedy
                School.<br>
            </p>
            <p>“As we reflect on the safe, fun and friendly 2022 Carnival Season, the City of New Orleans is committed
                to
                continuing
                that momentum in 2023 to ensure yet another successful Carnival Season,” said Mayor LaToya Cantrell.
